# Practice ML/DL algos from scratch! 

This repo is a collections of ML/DL alogorithm that are implemented from scratch.
Implementing algos from scatch help us a lot for better understanding of algorithms.

# 1. Impliment Mnist classifier from scratch (with numpy)! 
- File Name: MINST_scratch.ipynb
- Data: MNIST
- Test acc (so far) : ~85% (I will keep trying to get better test acc)

- TODO: 
  - remove noisy acc

# 2. Not decided yet




Note: These might not be the "perfect" notebooks in terms of acc. I will keep improving if I have time to revisit them.
